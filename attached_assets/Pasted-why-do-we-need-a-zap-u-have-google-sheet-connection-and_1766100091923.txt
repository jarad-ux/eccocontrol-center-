Great question — and you're right to push back on unnecessary complexity.

The key distinction:

Me: I only act when you're actively talking to me. I'm not a server running 24/7 listening for events.
Your Replit app: Needs to send data somewhere automatically when a sale is submitted, whether you're chatting with me or not.
You actually have two options:

Direct Google Sheets API in Replit (no Zapier needed)
Your app can write directly to Google Sheets using the Google Sheets API or a service account
This is cleaner, faster, and removes the middleman
I can help you add that code to your Replit app
Zapier webhook (more flexible but adds a layer)
Your app POSTs to a Zapier webhook URL
Zap catches it and writes to the sheet
Useful if you want to trigger multiple things (Slack notification, email, sheet update, etc.) from one submission
My recommendation: If all you need is "sale submitted → add row to Google Sheet," just build the Sheets integration directly into your Replit app. Simpler, fewer points of failure, no Zapier task limits to worry about.

Want me to help you add the Google Sheets API integration to your app? Just share the relevant file or let me know the structure and I can write the code.

Identified integration requirements and sought contextual details.




Perfect — let's do it the clean way.

To wire this up, I need a few things:

Your app's current code — specifically the file/route that handles sale submissions (or the main app file if it's small)
The Google Sheet URL you want to write to
What fields are captured when a sale is submitted (customer name, address, sale amount, date, rep, etc.)
Once I have that, I'll:

Set up Google Sheets API authentication using a service account
Add a function that appends a new row to your sheet whenever a sale comes through
Walk you through adding the service account credentials to your Replit secrets
Drop the code and sheet link when you're ready.
